# Assignment: create an API file system

**Goals:**

- [x] accepts a *GET* request `/listall`. Which will list and show all the files listed in the directory
    - **Some Bugs:**
        - not putting `"/"` after the route while sending request for the directory *generates error*.

- [ ] accept *GET* request `/createfile:filename/`. Which will create a file in with filename given in the params.
